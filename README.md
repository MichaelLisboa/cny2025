# CNY 2025 Lantern Experience

**CNY 2025** is an open-source 3D experience that merges tradition and technology with purpose and precision. This isn’t fluff, this is intentional design—a platform for creating, sharing, and celebrating Chinese New Year wishes in a dynamic, immersive digital environment. Built for speed, elegance, and seamless interaction, this app is designed for people who demand more from the web.

## Features
- **360° Interactive Sky:** A fluid, immersive starry night that rotates with your device or mouse—because static is boring.
- **Lantern Creation:** Choose from 13 zodiac-inspired lanterns or keep it blank. Add your wish, and let it float upward in glowing perfection.
- **Crowd Depth & Parallax:** A grounded crowd scene adds subtle depth and movement to make the experience feel alive without unnecessary noise.
- **User Wishes:** See real-time wishes from others, or focus on your own. It’s your experience.
- **Social Sharing:** Share your lantern with the world—email, social platforms, whatever you choose. Designed to be personal and shareable.

## Why Open Source?
This isn’t about gatekeeping. This is about community, experimentation, and pushing boundaries. By opening up this app, others can learn, use, and expand on it. It’s a foundation for creativity, not a locked-down experience.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS, 3JS, GSAP, and custom CSS. No bloated frameworks. Fast, minimal, intentional.
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL—because data needs structure, not clutter.
- **Hosting:** Deployed on Netlify for top-tier performance.

## For Designers
- 13 meticulously designed lanterns (12 zodiac + 1 blank) with a unified golden aesthetic.
- A high-resolution moon with a transparent background that casts dynamic lighting.
- Seamless, repeating starry sky graphic for an uninterrupted experience.
- A parallax-enabled crowd scene designed for depth and motion.

## For Developers
- Modular, reusable components: Clean, scalable code that doesn’t try too hard to be clever.
- API integration: Fast and efficient data calls for dynamic content.
- Lightweight: Built for speed without sacrificing the experience.

## Philosophy
This isn’t about trends or gimmicks. Every element, every line of code, is deliberate. The goal is simple: create something that looks stunning, performs flawlessly, and leaves an impression.
